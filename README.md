--Lab-Bench-Power-Supply
Adjustable lab bench power supply with voltage/current monitoring and cooling system.

A versatile and adjustable lab bench power supply designed for electronics prototyping and testing. This project features precise voltage and current control, real-time monitoring, efficient cooling, and enhanced safety components.

💡 Features
- Adjustable voltage and current output using precision potentiometer.
- Real-time display of voltage and current via a digital volt-amp meter and 16x2 I2C LCD.
- Built-in W1209 temperature module for automatic cooling control.
- Integrated exhaust and cooling fans for stable operation.
- Multiple output options with banana terminals and DC jack.

🔧 Components Used
- DC 24V 6A SMPS
- XL6009 Buck Converter
- Digital Volt-Amp Meter
- 16x2 I2C LCD Display
- W1209 Temperature Module
- Arduino Uno (with 7805 regulator for power)
- Exhaust and Cooling Fans
- Banana Terminals, Precision Potentiometer
- DC 12V Supply Module
- Capacitors and Diodes for stability
- Buzzer
- 12v DC Female Connector
- 7805 ic
- Mains Power Cord with connector and a SPST Switch

📜 How to Use
1. Connect the power cord (AC 220V ) to the SMPS .
2. Switch ON the Mains Switch
3. Adjust the voltage and current using the precision potentiometer.
4. Monitor output values on the volt-amp meter.
5. Use the W1209 module to control the fan based on temperature.

⚠️ Safety Tips
- Ensure proper heat dissipation with a heatsink for the 7805 regulator.
- Verify connections to prevent short circuits.
- Use a fuse for additional protection.
